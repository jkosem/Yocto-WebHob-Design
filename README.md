Yocto-WebHob-Design
===================

(GTK) Hob and WebHob
---------------------------------

There are a number of differences with the GTK or desktop-based version, and most of these difference revolve around the use of Projects to organise people working on a build, Groups and the ability to schedule and run builds on a server. The design also concentrates on collaborative features such as being able to report on and share builds as well as incorporating help and news alongside the functionality.

The Design of WebHob
--------------------------------

Its also important to note that this is a design and not a set of final requirements. There a lot of things (such as the Deploy function) which are ideas more than anything and there to see how the Yocto community responds and to gather feedback.

There are a number of graphics files included for distribution with this Yocto WebHob release, including a complete style sheet which was used to create the CSS used. Also included for use are a number of key screens in Photoshop format. The visual design is provided in the PSD and PNG folders in both formats. The PSD files are layered and appropriately labelled.


System Requirements (Twitter Bootstrap)
-------------------------------------------------------

<a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>
> provides simple and flexible HTML, CSS, and Javascript for popular user interface components and interactions. In other words, it's a front-end toolkit for faster, more beautiful web development. It's created and maintained by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter.

The WebHob prototype is written using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript (JQuery). All version numbers are commented in the code.

**Browser Support**
Twitter Bootstrap is created with modern browsers in mind. So, you will find it working perfectly with all the modern versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera and Internet Explorer.

Installation and Usage of the Prototype
----------------------------------------------------

The WebHob design prototype is a clickable web prototype and not a working web application. It is meant to serve as a way to demonstrate how WebHob would work as well as provide the working HTML, CSS and Javascript necessary to build WebHob. The forms do not function but many of the links work.
