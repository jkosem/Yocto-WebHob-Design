===================

Platform

*(GTK) Hob and WebHob*

There are a number of differences with the GTK or desktop-based version, and most of these difference revolve around the use of Projects to organise people working on a build, Groups and the ability to schedule and run builds on a server. The design also concentrates on collaborative features such as being able to report on and share builds as well as incorporating help and news alongside the functionality.

*The Design of WebHob*

Its also important to note that this is a design and not a set of final requirements. There a lot of things (such as the Deploy function) which are ideas more than anything and there to see how the Yocto community responds and to gather feedback. So if you have ideas and comments, please add them.
